`pcask1d` is a python package designed to compute the ground
state energy and density of a molecular system in one-dimension using
various approximations. `pcask1d` is periodic
 and uses a plane-wave basis set. 

Documentation is hosted on <http://pcask1d.readthedocs.io>. This documentation includes
the relevant theory and various example calculations.

#### Functionality
*****************

Density functional theory, Hartree, and Hartree-Fock calculations. 
Examples of each can be found in the documentation and in the `examples` directory.
